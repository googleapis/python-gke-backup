            during the restore execution.
        etag (str):
            Output only. ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency
            control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a
            restore from overwriting each other. It is strongly
            suggested that systems make use of the ``etag`` in the
            read-modify-write cycle to perform restore updates in order
            to avoid race conditions: An ``etag`` is returned in the
            response to ``GetRestore``, and systems are expected to put
            that etag in the request to ``UpdateRestore`` or
            ``DeleteRestore`` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the resource.
