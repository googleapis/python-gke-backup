class BackupPlan(proto.Message):
    r"""Defines the configuration and scheduling for a "line" of
    Backups.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Output only. The full name of the BackupPlan resource.
            Format: ``projects/*/locations/*/backupPlans/*``
        uid (str):
            Output only. Server generated global unique identifier of
            `UUID <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>`__
            format.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            BackupPlan resource was created.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The timestamp when this
            BackupPlan resource was last updated.
        description (str):
            User specified descriptive string for this
            BackupPlan.
        cluster (str):
            Required. Immutable. The source cluster from which Backups
            will be created via this BackupPlan. Valid formats:

            -  ``projects/*/locations/*/clusters/*``
            -  ``projects/*/zones/*/clusters/*``
        retention_policy (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.BackupPlan.RetentionPolicy):
            RetentionPolicy governs lifecycle of Backups
            created under this plan.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            A set of custom labels supplied by user.
        backup_schedule (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.BackupPlan.Schedule):
            Defines a schedule for automatic Backup
            creation via this BackupPlan.
        etag (str):
            Output only. ``etag`` is used for optimistic concurrency
            control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a
            backup plan from overwriting each other. It is strongly
            suggested that systems make use of the 'etag' in the
            read-modify-write cycle to perform BackupPlan updates in
            order to avoid race conditions: An ``etag`` is returned in
            the response to ``GetBackupPlan``, and systems are expected
            to put that etag in the request to ``UpdateBackupPlan`` or
            ``DeleteBackupPlan`` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the resource.
        deactivated (bool):
            This flag indicates whether this BackupPlan
            has been deactivated. Setting this field to True
            locks the BackupPlan such that no further
            updates will be allowed (except deletes),
            including the deactivated field itself. It also
            prevents any new Backups from being created via
            this BackupPlan (including scheduled Backups).

            Default: False
        backup_config (google.cloud.gke_backup_v1.types.BackupPlan.BackupConfig):
            Defines the configuration of Backups created
            via this BackupPlan.
        protected_pod_count (int):
            Output only. The number of Kubernetes Pods
            backed up in the last successful Backup created
            via this BackupPlan.
    """

    class RetentionPolicy(proto.Message):
        r"""RetentionPolicy defines a Backup retention policy for a
        BackupPlan.

        Attributes:
            backup_delete_lock_days (int):
                Minimum age for Backups created via this BackupPlan (in
                days). This field MUST be an integer value between 0-90
                (inclusive). A Backup created under this BackupPlan will NOT
                be deletable until it reaches Backup's (create_time +

                BackupPlan does NOT affect existing Backups under it.
                Backups created AFTER a successful update will inherit the
                new value.

                Default: 0 (no delete blocking)
            backup_retain_days (int):
                The default maximum age of a Backup created via this
                BackupPlan. This field MUST be an integer value >= 0. If
                specified, a Backup created under this BackupPlan will be
                automatically deleted after its age reaches (create_time +
                backup_retain_days). If not specified, Backups created under
                this BackupPlan will NOT be subject to automatic deletion.
                Updating this field does NOT affect existing Backups under
                it. Backups created AFTER a successful update will
                automatically pick up the new value. NOTE:
                backup_retain_days must be >=
                [backup_delete_lock_days][google.cloud.gkebackup.v1.BackupPlan.RetentionPolicy.backup_delete_lock_days].

                Default: 0 (no automatic deletion)
            locked (bool):
                This flag denotes whether the retention policy of this
                BackupPlan is locked. If set to True, no further update is
                allowed on this policy, including the ``locked`` field
                itself.
